# Azure — Security Labs & Notes

This repository contains hands on labs and notes focused on **Azure security fundamentals**.

I explore cloud security not only because it’s relevant today, but because I genuinely enjoy the topic and see it as a core part of the future of cybersecurity.

My goal is to build a **complete security mindset**.

## What this repository includes

Inside this repository you may find labs related to:

- Identity and access management
- Logging and monitoring
- Storage security
- Basic cloud infrastructure hardening

The labs are practical and focused on **how things actually work**, not just theory.

## How I approach Azure security

I treat Azure as a system, not as a checklist.

My approach is to:
- understand default configurations
- observe how services communicate
- identify where security controls are weak or missing
- learn how monitoring and logs help detect issues

This helps me reason about cloud security instead of memorizing settings.

## Why cloud security matters to me

Cloud environments are dynamic, distributed, and increasingly central to modern systems.

Many real world security issues don’t come from advanced attacks, but from:
- misconfigurations
- excessive permissions
- lack of visibility

Understanding cloud security helps me connect offensive, defensive, and architectural perspectives into a broader view of security.

## Notes

- This repository reflects my current learning stage
- Labs are intentionally simple and focused
- The goal is clarity, not complexity
